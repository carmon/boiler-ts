# Carmon's TypeScript boilerplates

Multiple typescript kickable environments, mixed with some code challenges branchs, with cool ideas (will be deleted in the future).

## Branches descriptions

- `react`: last react flavored with webpack 5
- `sprout-challenge`: some simple math challenge (it was fun!), features pickled-cucumber for testing, pure ts-node app
- `schema-issue`: I put that here to PR a `mural-schema` bug, I think patoz solved it already

### Start coding, bitch!
